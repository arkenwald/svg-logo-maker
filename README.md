ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End
Challenge 13

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

This back end for an e-commerce site was created by modifying starter code given to us.

Express.js API and Sequelize was used to interact with a MySQL database.

Installation

To install the project:

npm i

mysql source schema.sql

npm run seed

npm start

Usage

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
